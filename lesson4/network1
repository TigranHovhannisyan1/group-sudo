1. Verify whether dhclient is running.
	ps fax | grep dhclient
2. Display your current ip address(es).
	/sbin/ifconfig | grep 'inet '
3. Display the configuration file where this ip address is defined.
	cat /etc/network/interfaces
4. Follow the nic configuration in the book to change your ip address from dhcp client to fixed. Keep the same ip address to avoid conflicts!
	ifdown lo
	vi /etc/network/interfaces
	ifup lo

5.  Did  you  also  configure  the  correct  gateway  in  the  previous  question  ?  If  not,  then  do this now.
	route add default gw 172.20.51.2
	route del default gw 172.20.51.2
6. Verify that you have a gateway.
	/sbin/route or route
7. Verify that you can connect to the gateway, that it is alive.
	 ping -c3 172.20.51.2
8. Change the last two digits of your mac address.
	ifconfig -a|grep HWaddr
		d4:3d:7e:b3:4c:ea 
	ifconfig lo hw ether 08:00:27:ab:67:XX

9. Which ports are used by http, pop3, ssh, telnet, nntp and ftp ?
	 grep pop3 /etc/services 
	 grep http /etc/services 
	 grep ssh /etc/services 
	 grep telnet /etc/services 
	 grep nntp /etc/services 
	 grep ftp /etc/services 

10. Explain why e-mail and websites are sent over tcp and not udp.
	Քանի որ tcp- ն հուսալի է եւ udp- ը չէ:
	
	
11. Display the hostname  of your computer.
	hostname
12. Which ip-addresses did your computer recently have contact with ?
	 arp -a
	


		5.11. practice: ssh

1. Install sshd on the server
	apt-get install openssh-server
2.Verify in the ssh configuration files that only protocol version 2 is allowed
	grep Protocol /etc/ssh/ssh*_config
3. Use ssh to log on to the server, show your current directory and then exit the server.
	ssh student@172.20.51.62
4. Use scp to copy a file from your computer to the server.
	scp localfile user@server:~
5. Use scp to copy a file from the server to your computer.
	scp user@server:~/serverfile .
6. (optional, only works when you have a graphical install of Linux) Install the xeyes package
on the server and use ssh to run xeyes on the server, but display it on your client.
	apt-get install xeyes
	ssh -X student@172.20.51.72
8. Use ssh-keygen to create a key pair without passphrase. Setup passwordless ssh between you and your neighbour. (or between your client and your server)
 	ssh-keygen -t rsa
 	chmod 700 .ssh/
 	scp id_rsa.pub bob@192.168.48.92:~/.ssh/authorized_keys
 	cat id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
 
 9.Verify that the permissions on the server key files are correct; world readable for the public keys and only root access for the private keys.
 	ls -l /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*
 
 10. Verify that the ssh-agent is running.
 	ps fax | grep ssh-agent
 
 11. (optional) Protect your keypair with a passphrase, then add this key to the ssh-agent and test your passwordless ssh to the server.
 	man ssh-keygen
 	man ssh-agent
 	man ssh-add
